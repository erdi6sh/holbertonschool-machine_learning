# 📊 Probability Distributions — Holberton School Machine Learning

This folder (`math/probability`) contains Python classes that represent several **probability distributions**, each implemented from scratch for educational purposes.  
These include the **Poisson**, **Exponential**, **Normal**, and **Binomial** distributions.

Each class can:
- Estimate its parameters from data.
- Calculate distribution functions such as PMF, PDF, or CDF.
- Validate input types and ranges properly.

## 📘 Overview

This project is part of the **Holberton School Machine Learning** curriculum.  
You’ll find classes that represent and compute different probability distributions manually — without using pre-built functions from libraries such as `scipy`.

Each distribution:
- Has a constructor that accepts **either raw data** or **parameter values**.
- Can calculate important probability functions (PMF, PDF, CDF).
- Demonstrates real-world use of mathematical statistics in code.
