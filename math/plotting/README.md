# 🧮 0x01. Plotting — Matplotlib

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on learning how to use **Matplotlib** and **NumPy** to visualize data in Python.  
You’ll create multiple types of plots such as line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts.

Each task builds on the previous one, ending with a combined multi-plot figure and a stacked bar chart.
