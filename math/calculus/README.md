# 📘 Calculus Overview

## 🧮 Introduction
**Calculus** is a branch of mathematics that focuses on **change and accumulation**. It provides the tools to model and analyze real-world phenomena involving motion, growth, and varying quantities. Calculus forms the foundation for many fields including **physics, engineering, economics, computer science**, and **biology**.

## 🔹 Main Branches of Calculus

### 1. **Differential Calculus**
- Concerned with **rates of change** and **slopes of curves**.  
- The central concept is the **derivative**, which measures how a quantity changes with respect to another.  
- **Example:** Finding the speed of a car at a specific moment, given its position over time.

### 2. **Integral Calculus**
- Focuses on **accumulation**, such as finding **areas**, **volumes**, or **totals**.  
- The main concept is the **integral**, which combines infinitely small parts to find a whole.  
- **Example:** Calculating the total distance traveled by integrating the car’s speed over time.

## 🔁 The Connection: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
This theorem links differentiation and integration, showing that they are **inverse operations**.  
In simple terms:
> Differentiation breaks things apart, while integration puts them back together.

## 🧠 Applications of Calculus
- **Physics:** Motion, forces, energy, and electricity  
- **Engineering:** Design, fluid dynamics, and optimization  
- **Economics:** Cost, revenue, and profit analysis  
- **Biology:** Population growth and rate of reactions  
- **Computer Science:** Machine learning, graphics, and algorithms

## 🧾 Key Concepts and Symbols

| Concept | Description | Symbol |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Derivative | Rate of change or slope | f'(x), dy/dx |
| Integral | Area under a curve or accumulation | ∫ f(x) dx |
| Limit | Value a function approaches | lim x→a |
| Function | Relationship between input and output | f(x) |

## 🧩 Example Problem

If a function describes the position of a car:  
**x(t) = t² + 2t**

Then:  
- **Velocity** (rate of change of position):  
  `v(t) = dx/dt = 2t + 2`  
- **Total distance traveled** from t = 0 to t = 3:  
  `∫₀³ (2t + 2) dt = [t² + 2t]₀³ = 9 + 6 = 15`

## 📚 Summary
Calculus is the mathematics of **change and motion**. It bridges the gap between algebra and real-world dynamics, allowing us to describe and predict how things evolve over time.
