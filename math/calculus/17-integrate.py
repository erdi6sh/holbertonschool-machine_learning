def poly_integral(poly, C=0):
    """
    Calculates the integral of a polynomial.

    The polynomial is represented as a list of coefficients.
    The index of each coefficient represents the power of x.

    Example:
        If f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 5, then poly = [5, 3, 0, 1]
        Integral: F(x) = 5x + 1.5x^2 + 0x^3 + 0.25x^4 + C
        Output: [C, 5, 1.5, 0, 0.25]

    Args:
        poly (list): List of coefficients representing a polynomial.
        C (int, optional): Integration constant. Defaults to 0.

    Returns:
        list: New list of coefficients representing the integral.
        None: If poly or C are not valid.
